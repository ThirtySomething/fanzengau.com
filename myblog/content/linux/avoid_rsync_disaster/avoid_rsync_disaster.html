	<h3>Does trailing slash ("/") make a difference?</h3>
	<p>
		In Linux commands, often times a trailing slash ("/") does not make a difference 
		when referring to directories.
	</p>
	<p>
		However there comes times when we do need to be careful about trailing slashes.
		A quick example will be when a supplied path is going to be concatenated with a file name,
		a decent programer should know how to take care of that 
		(for instance, in Python, better use os.path.join instead of path + filename to generate a full path).
		Besides path construction errors, the existence of a trailing slash can trigger a different action 
		to be taken by the program, and may not be what's expected.
	</p>
	<p>
		Specifying files and directories to be ignored by Git in .gitignore is definitely one example, 
		but that's another (long) story. 
		Today I'd like to talk about troubles that can be caused by incorrect/careless 
		usage of rsync.
	</p>
	<p>
		rsync is often used in the back up process. 
		Sometime we'd like to make the two copies exactly the same replica of each other.
		Note if there are files that have been deleted in the source folder, 
		rsync will not delete them unless you set the "--delete" parameter. 
		Now you've probably guessed where I'm heading.
	</p>

	<h3>The most important take-away lesson:</h3>
	<p>
		Please always do a dry run (with "-n") first if "--delete" is specified in the rsync command. 
		Remove only the "-n" for the actual run. If anything has been changed, better do another dry run.
	</p>

	<h3>Wait and make sure there are no surprises</h3>
	<p>
		When backing up large file systems, 
		a cautious dev-op would monitor the rsync process at least for a few initial seconds/minutes, 
		and be ready to "Ctrl-C" if something does not look right, before leaving for lunch.
		For instance, if he sees in the output terminal that stuff supposed to
		be left alone are being smashed, he can abort immediately to minimize the loss.
	</p>

	<h3>Double check where you are before rm -rf</h3>
	<p>
		As a side note, whenever you issue destructive commands like "rm -rf",
		please double check which computer you're on and which directory you are in. 
		More often than you'd expect, 
		people accidentaly delete the good copies when their intension is to delete the messed-up ones instead.
	</p>
	<h3>To slash or not to slash</h3>
	<p>
		It turns out that, in rsync, trailing slashes do matter. So if we're not careful with it,
		especially when combined with the usage of "--delete", we can end up deleting stuff
		in the destination. If rsync finds in destination files that don't exist in the source,
		it will believe they should be deleted since you've specified "--delete". And it's just doing its
		job of making sure the destination look exactly the same as the source, no more, no less, 
		as is specified.
	</p>
	<p>
		So here comes the question, how to avoid such mistakes. One safe solution is to create a temp 
		directory at the destination and supply it as the destination argument, in this way we can be sure 
		nothing is in the destination directory and we have nothing to lose. The downside is 
		we may need to move things out of this temp directory afterwards, which could take time if what 
		we are syncing is big.
	</p>
	<p>
		If we want to sync into the desired location in one go, 
		we need to understand how the source and destination arguments
		passed to rsync are interpreted.
	</p>
	<p> Below is a little test script I wrote to compare the four
		combinations of with/without a trailing slash at the end of source/destination arguments.
	</p>
	<p>
		Everything happens in a test directory, which contains a src directory and a dst directory.
		Inside src there are two blank files a.txt and b.txt. 
		Inside dst there is a blank file c.txt.
	</p>
	<p>
		The four variants of rsync commands are issued to sync src to dst.
		An additional test of rsync with "--delete" specified that results in the deletion of c.txt
		in dst is also included.
	</p>
	<p>
		The test directory is reset to its inital status after each test of rsync.
		The before vs. after tree structure of the test directory are printed out for examination.

	<div>
		<p>run_me.txt</p>
		<iframe onload='embedText(this, "code/test_rsync/run_me.txt")'></iframe>
	</div>
	<p>
		We can see from the output, a trailing slash at the end of src does make a difference,
		whereas it doesn't matter at the end of dst.
		When there is no slash at the end of src, rsync will place the entire src folder under the dst directory.
		When there is a trailing slash at the end of src, rsync will sync the contents of src and place them
		under the dst directory. The former case is where files in the destination directory can be deleted
		if "--delete" flag is specified to rsync, as shown in the example.
