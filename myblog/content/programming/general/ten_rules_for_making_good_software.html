<h3>Use a UI instead of CLI to show your error message.</h3>
    <p>
        If something is missing / wrong and your program cannot launch successfully, 
        depending on your user demographics, 
        but it's generally better to use a graphical user interface to display 
        the error message and show them how to fix it, 
        than vomiting in ther terminal, 
        especially when people are expecting to see a graphical UI. 
        A friendly interace will improve the user's perception of the usability of the software.

<h3>Dependency minimumism</h3>
    <p>
        Remember, the more dependencies your program has, 
        the more likely that some one is going to run into dependency issues and thus not able to use your program.
        It is also more likely that your program will break in the future, 
        because e.g. some function in some library you use has been deprecated, 
        or, your libraries are all kind enough to not touch the legacy
        public interface, but they can't control their third party dependencies, can they?

        For example, a project depends on a particular version of CUDA, 
        which does not play very well in the backwards-compatibility game, 
        and people with the latest Nvidia GPU may not have the old version of CUDA.
        It can be very possible that such a repository can go obselete 
        when more and more people upgrades their CUDA 
        and lose the ability to compile the project.
        Same goes with OpenCV, if a project supports only a lower version of OpenCV, 
        then people with higher versions might encounter errors and give up on using the repository.

<h3>Check for edge cases and producing warnings</h3>
    <p>
        It's most likely better to fail with an meaningful error message 
        than to run seamingly well with hidden bugs. 
        If you really don't have time, at least type 4 letters, "TODO".
