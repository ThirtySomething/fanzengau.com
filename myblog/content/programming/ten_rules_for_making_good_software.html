<h2>Use a UI instead of CLI to show your error message.</h2>
If something is missing / wrong and your program cannot launch successfully, depending on your user demographics, but it's generally better to use a graphical user interface to display the error message and show them how to fix it, than vomiting in ther termincal, especially when people are expecting to see a graphical UI. A friendly interace will improve the user's perception of the usability of the software.

<h2>Dependency minimuism</h2>
Remember, the more dependencies your program has, the more likely that some one is going to run into dependency issues and thus not able to use your program.

<h2>Check for edge cases and producing warnings</h2>
It's most likely better to fail with an meaningful error message than to run seamingly well with hidden bugs. If you really don't have time, at least type 4 letters, "TODO".
